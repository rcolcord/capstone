### Predicting photo-voltaic solar power generation

Robert Colcord

#### Executive summary
Solar energy is going to be a cornerstone of the future clean energy grid. I want to explore methods for predicting the power generated by a solar PV system.

#### Rationale
The ability to make predictions about the power that can be generated will be critical for utilities, governments, businesses, and consumers alike as they make decisions about where and how to install solar energy systems.

#### Research Question
Can we predict the power generated by a photo-voltaic solar panel system?

#### Data Sources
The data contains 4213 samples from a solar power plant. The sample features contain information about the positioning of the panels and meteorological information. The features are labeled as follows:
- temperature_2_m_above_gnd
- relative_humidity_2_m_above_gnd
- mean_sea_level_pressure_MSL
- total_precipitation_sfc
- snowfall_amount_sfc
- total_cloud_cover_sfc
- high_cloud_cover_high_cld_lay
- medium_cloud_cover_mid_cld_lay
- low_cloud_cover_low_cld_lay
- shortwave_radiation_backwards_sfc
- wind_speed_10_m_above_gnd
- wind_direction_10_m_above_gnd
- wind_speed_80_m_above_gnd
- wind_direction_80_m_above_gnd
- wind_speed_900_mb
- wind_direction_900_mb
- wind_gust_10_m_above_gnd
- angle_of_incidence
- zenith
- azimuth

The output data is the power generated by the panels in kilowatts.

#### Methodology
##### Data Processing
##### Modeling
Various forms of regression:
- Linear Regression
- Ridge Regression
- Lasso Regression
- Linear Regression w/ Forward Feature Selection
- Linear Regression w/ Lasso Feature Selection
- SVM Regression

#### Results
All models tested performed significantly better than the baseline model which produced a MSE of 913608.02
