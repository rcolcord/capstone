### Predicting photo-voltaic solar power generation

Robert Colcord

#### Executive summary
Solar energy is going to be a cornerstone of the future clean energy grid. I want to explore methods for predicting the power generated by a solar PV system.

#### Rationale
The ability to make predictions about the power that can be generated will be critical for utilities, governments, businesses, and consumers alike as they make decisions about where and how to install solar energy systems.

#### Research Question
Can we predict the power generated by a photo-voltaic solar panel system?

#### Data Sources
Data from a single power plant:

Potential alternate data source:

#### Methodology
Various forms of regression:
- Linear Regression
- Ridge Regression
- Lasso Regression
- Linear Regression w/ Forward Feature Selection
- Linear Regression w/ Lasso Feature Selection
- Support Vector Regression, time permitting

#### Results
Linear Regression with Forward Feature Selection performed the best with the lowest test MSE, although comparably to all the other models other than Ridge Regression. Ridge Regression performed significantly worse than all other models, but interestingly, had the lowest training MSE, showing significant overfitting.

(TODO: attach result charts)

#### Next steps
TBD
